# Induction-Programme
Gursanjam Singh CE 
# ðŸŽ“ Day 1 
My first day at GNDEC began on a spiritual note as all the AI,EE,ECE,CE and ME students assembled in the Gurudwara, where we participated in prayers and then had Langar, embracing a sense of unity and humility. Afterward, we served snacks and drinks, fostering a welcoming environment. We then gathered in the auditorium for the official induction program. Following a lunch break, we visited our respective departments, where we were introduced to the faculty and given a glimpse into the academic journey ahead.
