# üéì Day 1 
My first day at GNDEC began on a spiritual note as all the AI,EE,ECE,CE and ME students assembled in the Gurudwara, where we participated in prayers and then had Langar, embracing a sense of unity and humility. Afterward, we served snacks and drinks, fostering a welcoming environment. We then gathered in the auditorium for the official induction program. Following a lunch break, we visited our respective departments, where we were introduced to the faculty and given a glimpse into the academic journey ahead.

Our Principal Sir then motivated us to make the best use of this platform. The NSET Director introduced us to the illustrious history of this institution, emphasizing its 68 years of shaping brilliant minds. He highlighted the first 36 years, which were dedicated to establishing the institute.

I learned an essential lesson: ‚ÄúSeize the opportunity; don‚Äôt wait for it to come to you.‚Äù

Next, the ADGP Officer shared invaluable insights about karma and the delayed rewards of good deeds. He spoke from experience for about an hour without any preparation, which was impressive. One piece of advice that stood out was: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be easily impressed; there‚Äôs always more to learn.‚Äù

Students who interacted and spoke up received chocolates. In the end, I missed out on chocolates but gained countless lessons, some the hard way. I resolved never to miss an opportunity again.

# Day 2

A new opportunity arose thanks to Dr. Arvind Dhingra. He helped me shed my reserved behavior and start interacting with others. He asked for 11 boys and 11 girls to come up on stage. Determined not to miss any opportunity, I joined them. We played a team strategy game and introduced ourselves to our peers.

Then, Dr. H.S. Rai, the Controller of Examination, spoke. His perspective on examinations was fascinating, viewing them as opportunities to shine.

# Day 3  Universal Human Values, Canva Insights, and CodeGNE Leadership

Today marked the third day of my college journey, and it was packed with learning, interaction, and leadership.

#### Universal Human Values: A Path to Happiness

Our first lecture of the day was on Universal Human Values, a subject that delves into the essence of what it means to live a fulfilling and content life. We explored the concept of happiness and the state of contentment, discussing how these states of mind influence our everyday actions and decisions. The session was enlightening, providing a fresh perspective on how we can achieve true happiness. We also shared real-life scenarios, which made the discussion more relatable and impactful.

#### Canva: Unlocking Creative Potential

After a refreshing break, we engaged in a peer interaction session where our seniors introduced us to Canva. Canva is a powerful tool for creating visually appealing designs, and the seniors did an excellent job explaining its features and potential uses. From designing posters to creating social media graphics, Canva offers a versatile platform for expressing creativity. This session was particularly beneficial for those of us looking to enhance our presentation and design.

### Reflections

Today's experiences highlighted the importance of values, creativity, and leadership in our academic and personal growth. The lecture on Universal Human Values reminded me that happiness and contentment are pivotal in shaping our lives. The Canva session unlocked new creative avenues, and the doubt session reinforced the significance of teamwork and guidance.

As I continue my journey, I am excited to apply these insights to my studies and extracurricular activities. Each day brings new opportunities to learn, grow, and contribute, and I am eager to embrace them all.

We learned Excel and ChatGPT in an exciting, hands-on class workshop organized by the Causmic Club. Instead of making a normal Excel sheet and performing calculations manually, we tried to do it with commands. I enjoyed it so much that I gave a video feedback after the lecture.

Later, we had a math session. Initially, recalling all the formulas was challenging, but I eventually got the hang of it and enjoyed the class. Our lecturer, a young assistant professor, was interactive and understanding.

Some of us attended a meeting of the CodeGNE club, a group that had grown to 50 members on Telegram.
# Day 4: GitHub, Poetic Inspiration, and Insights into Success

Day 4 of our induction program was a diverse and enriching experience, packed with valuable lessons and motivational insights.

## Morning: GitHub Introduction
Our day started in the auditorium with a session led by Dr. Randhir Sir. He introduced us to GitHub, a vital tool for version control and collaboration. With his guidance, we set up our first repository, marking an important step in our journey as budding developers. This hands-on introduction was both practical and exciting, providing us with a foundational skill that will be crucial throughout our academic and professional careers.

## Midday: Poetic Inspiration and Study Methods
The first speaker of the day, Dr. Pyare Lal, captivated us with famous poems and shared insights into traditional study methods. His poetic recitations provided a refreshing break and a different perspective on learning, reminding us of the beauty and depth that can be found in literature and the art of studying.

## Afternoon: Exploring the Essence of Life
Mr. Sony Goyal, our second speaker, offered profound insights into the concept of life. He explained that LIFE stands for:
- **Learn**
- **Inquire**
- **Future**
- **Explore**

He also shared two powerful mantras for success:

I‚Äôm looking forward to applying these lessons and diving deeper into both academic and extracurricular pursuits.

# Day 5: Exploring Human Values, Canva, and Improvisation Skills

Day 5 of our induction program was packed with insightful lectures and practical activities, offering a blend of philosophical understanding and hands-on learning.

## Morning: Universal Human Values (UHV)
Our day began with a lecture on Universal Human Values (UHV). The session delved into the coexistence of the Self and Body, highlighting their distinct needs:
- **The Self** seeks happiness, driven by desires, thoughts, and expectations. These activities are continuous and revolve around knowing, assuming, recognizing, and fulfilling.
- **The Body** requires physical facilities such as food and other material needs, which are temporary and involve recognizing and fulfilling immediate needs.

We learned that the Self, as a Consciousness Entity, and the Body, as a Material Entity, have different types of needs. Misunderstanding these differences can lead to feelings of deprivation and exploitation. Imagination, driven by sensation, pre-conditioning, or natural acceptance, plays a crucial role in the Self. Harmony in the Self is achieved when imagination aligns with natural acceptance, and this harmony is reflected in the Body‚Äôs well-being through self-regulation.

## Midday: Introduction to Canva
In the second lecture of the day, our seniors introduced us to Canva, a versatile design tool. We were guided through the basics of the platform and created our first template. This hands-on experience was both creative and educational, providing us with practical skills for designing visually appealing content.

## Upscaling Project Management Skills

Leadership is not just about guiding others but also about continuous self-improvement. My role in CodeGNE has allowed me to refine my project management skills. Coordinating tasks, setting deadlines, and ensuring that the team stays on track are essential aspects of effective leadership that I am continually learning and implementing.

Day 5 at CodeGNE has been transformative. It has provided me with a platform to hone my technical skills, embrace leadership responsibilities, and overcome challenges with determination. I am excited to continue this journey, leveraging my newfound skills to contribute effectively to my team and future projects. 

With each step, I am becoming more confident in my abilities and more enthusiastic about the endless possibilities that lie ahead in the field of computer science and engineering.

His journey was not just a narrative but a source of inspiration, reminding us of the resilience and determination required to overcome life's challenges. Prof. Pannu also shared various Sakhis of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, which were both enlightening and thought-provoking, offering us valuable life lessons.

### Understanding Relationships through Universal Human Values

Following Prof. Pannu's session, we attended a lecture on Universal Human Values (UHV), which focused on understanding the essence of relationships. The key takeaway was that relationships are not merely interactions but connections between two selves. We learned about the nine feelings that form the foundation of any relationship: Trust, Respect, Affection, Care, Guidance, Reverence, Glory, Gratitude, and Complete Love. This session provided profound insights into how we perceive and nurture our relationships.

### The Benefits of Joining the National Cadet Corps (NCC)

After the UHV session, we regrouped in the auditorium for a talk by Dr. Harwinder Singh, ANO of the NCC. He introduced us to the myriad benefits of joining the NCC, emphasizing the development of physical fitness, mental strength, personality enhancement, and leadership skills. The NCC not only prepares students for potential careers in the armed forces but also instills invaluable life skills such as discipline, teamwork, and communication. Notable benefits include the Sahara Scholarship for NCC cadets, government-covered expenses for uniforms and camps, and opportunities for selection in the armed forces through NDA.

The NSS aims to engage students in community service, focusing on afforestation, AIDS awareness, blood donation camps, environmental cleanliness, and disaster management. Participation in NSS offers numerous benefits, including personality development, preferential treatment in admissions and employment, and opportunities to engage in national integration camps and adventure programs. Through these activities, students develop leadership qualities, a democratic attitude, and a deep sense of involvement in nation-building.

### Reflections and Takeaways

The stories shared, values discussed, and opportunities presented have given us much to reflect upon as we continue our journey through this induction program. Whether it's through understanding the depth of relationships, embracing the discipline and skills of the NCC, or committing to community service with the NSS, we are encouraged to grow into well-rounded individuals.
